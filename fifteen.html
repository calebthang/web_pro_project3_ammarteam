    <h1>Fifteen Puzzle</h1>

      The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares by
      repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space. How
      quickly can you solve it?

    <p class="credit">
      American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
      credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until
      his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created
      around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
